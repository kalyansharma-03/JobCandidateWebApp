# Job Candidate Hub Application

This .NET-based job candidate hub application is designed to add or update job candidate details based on the uniqueness of their email address.

## Potential Improvements

**1. Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Implement more granular error handling.
   - Use a logger to capture exceptions and provide detailed feedback to the user.

**2. Validation Refinement**
   - Add comprehensive validation logic.
   - Include custom validation for LinkedIn and GitHub profile URLs.

**3. Caching**
   - Implement a robust caching strategy, such as Redis, for better scalability.

**4. API Documentation**
   - Provide thorough API documentation to facilitate developer understanding and usage of the API.

**5. Security Enhancements**
   - Add authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Assumptions

1. **ASP.NET Core Version**:
   - Assumes that the project is using .NET 6 or later. Adjustments may be necessary for earlier versions.

2. **Validation Scope**:
   - Assumes that basic validation, such as email format and required fields, is sufficient.
